			h2 Teaching for Understanding
			p
				| Teaching that focuses on developing secure and deep understanding, including the use of practical
				| resources and iconic representations supports the learning and memorisation of mathematical concepts. 
				| The teaching of 'rules' and 'tricks' with no understanding and the use of only ‘standard’ examples
				| contribute to learners feeling they 'can't do' maths.
		.card 
			h2 Belief
			p 
				| All learners need to believe they can succeed and also believe that their teacher, and parents,
				| believe they can succeed. Adopting a growth mindset is at the heart of a 'Can Do Maths’ approach
				| including the use of 'yet’ and knowing that making mistakes is an essential part of learning. 
				| Parents, teachers and the media thinking it's acceptable to use phrases such as 'Don't worry,
				| I can't do maths', 'Maths is too hard', etc all contribute to learners feeling that they 'can't do'
				| maths.

		.card
			h2 Hard Work
			p 
				| Success comes from hard work. It's as simple as that!
				| Mathematics can be difficult at times but success can be achieved through hard work.
